<ul>
  <li>Previously, some S1 Pro Systems would shut down if the AC power was interrupted. On those units firmware 7.0.11 changes the way an interruption to the AC power affects the S1 Pro:</li>
  <li>When an interruption in AC power is detected, the S1 Pro will go silent for four to seven seconds. The audio will resume without intervention from you. During the silence, you may notice the channel one LED turn amber. This is normal.</li>
</ul>
